<p>
In economics, currency refers to a generally accepted medium of exchange. 
These are usually the coins and banknotes of a particular government, 
which comprise the physical aspects of a nation's money supply. The other 
part of a nation's money supply consists of bank deposits (sometimes 
called deposit money), ownership of which can be transferred by means of 
cheques, debit cards, or other forms of money transfer. Deposit money and 
currency are money in the sense that both are acceptable as a means of 
payment.
